This was my very first project I did in Java. I had an idea of what I wanted to do: I just wanted to make a game in a language I was already familiar with. T was able to make 
a dungeon based text-game that outputs in the console. I used character names from my favorite video game: Destiny and then programmed the functionality of the game. This 
was a super awesome experience and it was really satisfying to see my first project run and compile successfully!
